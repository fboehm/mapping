This lesson introduces genetic mapping using qtl2, a R package for analyzing quantitative phenotypes and genetic data. Genetic mapping with qtl2 allows researchers in fields as diverse as agriculture, evolution, and medicine to identify specific chromosomal regions that contribute variation to phenotypes. The goal of this process is to identify the action, interaction, number, and precise location of these regions.

Participants will be able to
